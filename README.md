# Card Calisthenics

Create a deck, shuffle it up, and each card that is drawn is a different exercise. This is my own workout I made up during quarantine to change up the monotony and decided to automate it.

## The rules:

- An Ace or Joker is 25 sit-ups (or any ab exercise of your choosing)
- A number card between 2 and 5 is that many burpees
- A card 6 and above is that many push-ups or squats. The exercises are alternating, so the first one will be squats, the next one is push-ups.
- Face card values are Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13

In total, you end up with 150 sit-ups, 56 burpees, and around 150 push-ups and squats (plus/minus 10)

## This is too easy!

- Multiply by or add X to whatever card you draw
- Choose tougher variants of each exercise
- Add weight to any of the exercises
